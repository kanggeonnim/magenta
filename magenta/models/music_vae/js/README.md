# MusicVAE Deeplearn.js Implementation

COMING SOON!

## Test Usage

`yarn install` to get dependencies

`yarn run build` to produce a commonjs version with typescript definitions for MusicVAE in the dist/ folder that can then be consumed by others over NPM.

`yarn run build-demo` to build the demo.

`http-server demo/` to see it working.
